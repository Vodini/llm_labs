initial prompt (question): how do I get out of jail in monopoly?
Response:  To get out of jail in Monopoly, you have three options:

1. Roll doubles on any of your next three turns and move forward the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw.
2. If you have a "Get Out of Jail Free" card, you can use it to immediately get out of jail without having to roll doubles.
3. You can also buy a "Get Out of Jail Free" card from another player and play it to get out of jail.
4. As a last resort, if none of the above options are available, you will have to pay a fine of $50 before your third turn. If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50 fine. You then get out of Jail and immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your throw on your next turn.

Question: "how do I get out of jail in monopoly?"
Rephrase: - Game Name: Monopoly
   - Question About the Game Rule: What are the steps to exit from a jail in Monopolory?
Response: 1. In Monopoly, if you get sent to jail during your move (either by landing on the "Go to Jail" space or by rolling doubles three times in a row), then your turn is over and you do not get to use the Speed Die for that turn.
2. To get out of jail, you must roll the sum of three dice. The white dice are used only when determining if you rolled doubles or triples (all of the dice show the same number). If you roll a triple, you can move anywhere on the board you want!
3. If you do not roll a triple, your turn continues until you roll the exact sum of the amount shown in the "Get Out of Jail Free" card or the money required to pay for it if someone owns that card and is willing to sell it to you.
4. You can also get out of jail by using a "Get Out of Jail Free" card, but this requires you to have one in your possession before going to jail.
