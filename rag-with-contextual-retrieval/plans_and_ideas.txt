- Fine-tune a model for article/text summarization using PNAS articles (body vs abstract) on Bielik2 and check how summarization works on polish texts 



- RAG issues with retrieval - how to tune embedding model:
-- generate questions to embedded text by larger LLM
-- cluster questions and pair them together (having fitting question vs non-fitting question, but from similar space)
-- finetune an embedding model with DPO for a closer e.g. cosine distance between a fitting question and embedded than non-fitting question and vice versa (distance between fitting and non-fitting text to embedded question)
