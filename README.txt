Repository based and on the pixegami tutorial stored here:
https://github.com/pixegami/rag-tutorial-v2
Main motivation of repository: to test LLM-based solutions.
Here I have a few tests of RAG solutions:
- text formatting for retrieval search 
- semantic text split for RAG and retrieval
- metaprompting for model reasoning
- context adding to semantic split inspired by following article of anthropic:
